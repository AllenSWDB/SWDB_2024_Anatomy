This type of long-range projection analysis is only applicable for the LM neurons since the EM neurons were reconstructed within a small piece of tissue fully contained within the visual cortex. In contrast, we will see that many LM neurons have axons that project across several brain regions, see Figure X.  </font>\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"3ae4cebe-e70a-4807-9dd2-336b703eff81","metadata":{},"source":"<font size=\"3\" color='green'><b> Insert image of exaspim brain that shows maybe a few neurons that clearly project a long distance to emphasize the complexity of neural projections. </font>"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"4dd97c4a-8f23-4ffc-9060-1e0a364fdc1e","metadata":{"tags":[]},"source":"<div style=\"border-left: 3px solid #000; padding: 1px; padding-left: 10px; background: #F0FAFF; \">\n\n<font size=\"3.5\"> As an introduction to analyzing the projections of LM neurons, we will explore two open-ended questions related to brain connectivity that scientists consider when analyzing LM neurons. These questions aim to uncover both the fundamental connections and complex network dynamics that define the functional roles of these neurons within the broader neural circuitry. </font>\n\n<font size=\"3.5\"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Question 1:</strong> What do the inputs to a particular brain region look like? Where else do those inputs send their collaterals? </font>\n\n<font size=\"3.5\"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong>Question 2:</strong> Are neuronal morphologies stereotyped, or are there distinct projection classes?  </font>\n\n<font size=\"3.5\"> Both of these questions involve analyzing a large number of neurons to provide a general overview of how neurons <em>connect</em> different brain regions.  Before addressing these questions, we must first understand the meaning of <em>connectivity</em> at the level of a single neuron, then generalize this notion to the level of brain regions. In this context a neuron connects regions <em>A</em> and <em>B</em> if the neuron has dendritic endpoints in region <em>A</em> and axonal endpoints in region <em>B</em>. The dendritic endpoints receive the <em>input</em> of a neuron, whereas the axonal endpoints send the neuron's output.</font>\n\n<font size=\"3.5\" color='orange'><b> Explain inputs and outputs of a brain region </font>\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"e336a8c0-08a8-46b3-b849-3d9714f7eca2","metadata":{"tags":[]},"source":"<div style=\"border-left: 3px solid #000; padding: 1px; padding-left: 10px; background: #F0FAFF; \">\n\n<font size=\"5\"> Section 1.1: Strategy for Answering Scientific Questions </font>\n\n<font size=\"3.5\"> The first objective of this notebook is to walk through how to answer Question 1 by analyzing neurons from the exapsim dataset.
